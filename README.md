# Temprature-Converter

A simple Python script to convert temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit. Perfect for beginners learning input handling, conditionals, and basic arithmetic in Python.

## Features

- Converts Celsius to Fahrenheit
- Converts Fahrenheit to Celsius
- Handles invalid unit input gracefully

## How It Works

The script prompts the user to specify the temperature unit (`C` or `F`) and then enter the temperature value. Based on the unit, it performs the appropriate conversion and displays the result.

### Example

```bash

Is this temperature in (C)elsius or (F)ahrenheit? : C
Enter the temperature : 37
The temperature in Fahrenheit is 98.6Â°F.
